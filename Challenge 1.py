#                Challenge 1 - The Christmas Tree


# ************************* Part One *****************************


# Oh no! Santa needs a Christmas tree for their Christmas party.
# They need it quick! They need it pronto!
#
# The Christmas tree santa needs looks like this:
#
#                              *
#                             /^\
#                            /^^^\
#                           /^^^^^\
#                             |||
#
# It has a star on top, the edges of the Christmas tree are formed
# from slashes, the interior of the tree is filled with carets (^)
# and the trunk of the tree is formed by three straight lines
# (press shift + the key below backspace)
#
# Quickly! Write a program that prints this Christmas tree to the
# console so santa can be ready for Christmas!


# ************************* Part Two *****************************


# Oh no! Those pesky elves must have stolen some trees! Santa
# needs a lot more than one Christmas tree! Santa needs
# Christmas trees of size 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10!
#
# The size of a Christmas tree is the total height of the tree in
# lines. The tree printed above has a size of 5, the below tree
# has a size of 6:
#
#                              *
#                             /^\
#                            /^^^\
#                           /^^^^^\
#                          /^^^^^^^\
#                             |||
#
# Note that as the tree gets bigger it gets wider to retain its
# unique shape, but the trunk and the star stay the same and
# stay centered.
#
# Quickly! Write a program that prints a Christmas tree of size
# 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 to the console so that Santa isn't
# embarrassed at their party!
#
# Santa will give a present to the person who writes the program
# which executes the fastest! Submissions will end Friday 24/11.
#
#
# Due to North Pole compliance reasons all programs will be run
# in python. If it's written in a different language, elves will
# port it into python (potentially poorly).
